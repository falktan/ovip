# This workflow builds the source code to update the "docs"-folder in the release-branch.
# This folder is served by github pages.

# The app is hosted on github pages. For this the build app needs to be checked into source
# code management in a folder ```docs```. At the same time the build app is generated using
# webpack. Simply making the generated code part of the repository is problematic, as it
# can cause merge conflicts. To avoid this the build and release process works as follows:
# * Any ready to use code is merged into main
# * To "release" the current version of the main branch, it is merged into the release branch
# * After merging into the release branch the code is build there and the created ```dist```
#   folder is renamed to ```docs```. This is checked in.
# That means, that the release branch is the only branch that has a ```docs```-folder. This
# should never cause merge conflicts, as any code comes from the same branch ```main``` and
# any updates to the generated code happen exclusively on the release branch.
